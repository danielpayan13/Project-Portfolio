### 1. [Airline Passenger Satisfaction](https://github.com/danielpayan13/Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Data-Cleaning-and-EDA/Airline%20Passenger%20Satisfaction)

In this project we analyzed an airline passenger dataset to identify which factors had the strongest influence on customer satisfaction. This is part 1 of this project, with part 2 being in my [Machine-Learning](https://github.com/danielpayan13/Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Machine-Learning) repo as it covers predicting customer satisfaction and identifying the most signficant features.

### 2. [Introduction to Python](https://github.com/danielpayan13/Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Data-Cleaning-and-EDA/Introduction%20to%20Python)

This project is a notebook I developed as the President of the Data Analytics Club at Texas State University as a means of introducing students to some of the capabilities of Python. <br>
It covers topics such as:
* Reading in and displaying a dataset
* Manipulating columns
* Scatterplots, Histograms, Barplots, Heatmaps, & Pairplots

### 3. [League of Legends S12](https://github.com/danielpayan13/Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Data-Cleaning-and-EDA/League%20of%20Legends%20S12)

In this project we analyze a series of datasets from the game, *League of Legends*. We aim to uncover persistent patterns in a video game that attempts to shift and balance its meta every two weeks through balance patches to determine if there is an "easy" path to victory.

### 4. [Video Game Sales](https://github.com/danielpayan13/Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Data-Cleaning-and-EDA/Video%20Game%20Sales)

This project examines a dataset of video games with over 100,000 copies sold from 1980 to 2020. Through exploratory data analysis, we aim to answer: <br>
* **Which genre of games sold the most copies?**
* **Which games were most popular based on location?**
* **Which publishers were the most successful?**
* **How did the top platforms perform compared to one another?**
