    "In this notebook, we will **manipulate**, **analyze**, and **visualize** data from the game, ***League of Legends***, and attempt to uncover persistent patterns in a video game that attempts to shift and balance its **meta** every two weeks through patches. We will draw insights based on attributes, such as, **champion class**, **role**, **pick/ban rate**, **overall win rates**, and more to determine if there is an exploitable trend or \"easy\" path to victory!\n",
