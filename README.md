# <u>Project Portfolio</u>

This repo contains personal projects I have done in **Data Cleaning, EDA, and Machine Learning.** <br>
There are two folders in this repo that filter between Data Cleaning/EDA (Data-Cleaning-and-EDA) and Machine Learning (Machine-Learning) projects. <br>
Within each are the individual projects as well as descriptions of the work.
<br>

## Here are some of the figures/models from my work:
