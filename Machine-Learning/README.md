### 1. [Airline Passenger Satisfaction](https://github.com/danielpayan13/Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Machine-Learning/Airline%20Passenger%20Satisfaction)

In this project we analyzed an airline passenger dataset to identify which factors had the strongest
influence on customer satisfaction. We develop machine learning models to predict customer satisfaction,
as well as identify the top 10 factors that influence customer satisfaction through feature selection.
This is part 2 of this project, with part 1 being in my [Data-Cleaning-and-EDA](https://github.com/danielpayan13/Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Data-Cleaning-and-EDA)
repo as it covers the exploratory data analysis done on this dataset.

### 2. [Predicting Video Game Results](https://github.com/danielpayan13/Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Machine-Learning/Predicting%20Video%20Game%20Results)

This project develops a prediction model to determine whether or not the **Blue Team** wins a ranked game of 
*League of Legends* based on the game-state at 10 minutes. <br>
Five different models are used and compared:
* **Linear Regression**
* **Logistic Regression**
* **Ridge Regression**
* **Random Forest**
* **K-Nearest Neighbors**
